# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

For the method intersects in Range. The Data flow graph is as follows:
<img src="coverage_screenshots/Intersects_DFG.png" alt="coverage_screenshots/Intersects_DFG.png"/>

Each node is a statement, and the def-use sets are shown above each node, the DU-pairs for the variables are as follows:

| Variable (V) 	| Defined at node (n) 	| dcu(v, n) 	| dpu(v,n)       	|
|--------------	|---------------------	|-----------	|----------------	|
| b0           	| 1                   	| {4}       	| {[2,3], [2,4]} 	|
| b1           	| 1                   	| {3,4}     	|                	|
| Total:       	|                     	| 3         	| 2              	|

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

To develop new unit tests, we first developed a plan to ensure our test suite completed all the metrics that were required. To do this, we first began by looking at the method coverage for each class. We noted what the current value was from the Eclipse EclEmma tool, and noted how many more methods we would need to develop tests for to hit the 60% coverage goal mentioned in the assignment. For the Range class this meant developing tests for 13 more methods in addition to the ones from Assignment 2. For the DataUtilities class, [FILL IN LATER]. Once we had done this, we re-ran the coverage tool to ensure we had covered enough methods.

After we had noted what was still needed to acheive our method coverage goal, we moved on to looking at the branch coverage for each method. We began by running the branch coverage tool in EclEmma. We noted these values, and also looked at the source code. Then we looked at the possible paths for the method, as well as the tests we had already written and what paths they covered. We then wrote new cases to cover all of the missing branches that were possible to reach. there were some branches that were not possible to reach, which were left un-tested. After this was done, we re-ran the coverage tool to ensure we had covered more branches and reached our goal of 70%.

After completing the test cases to improve branch coverage, we finally moved on to statement coverage. To check our current progress, we used the line coverage option in EclEmma. We then examined the results in detail to check which methods had lines that had not been tested, then wrote methods to ensure these got covered to. After this was done, we re-ran the coverage tool to ensure our goal of 90% statement coverage had been acheived.

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation

Coverage-based test generation allowed us to be more efficient when designing test cases. We noticed when we used requirements-based test generation, sometimes we would have many tests covering the same lines of code and branches! Since we were doing black-box testing, we had no way of knowing this. However, when working with white-box testing and coverage-based generation, we were able to be more efficient when designing the tests.

Although our tests were more efficient when using coverage-based generation, our test creation process was slowed down. Rather than just reading the documentation for each method, we had to read through and understand the source code in order to write good quality tests for it.

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

We began by meeting and setting up our environment for this assignment together. We then ran the coverage tools together to ensure we all had the same values and understood what the results meant. After this, we divided up the work into 4 sections. The first section was creating the manual data-flow charts. The second section was updating the test suite for the Range tests that had been developed in Assignment 2. The third section was writing tests for the methods that had not been tested in Assignment 2. The final section was updating the tests for DataUtilities from Assignment 2. Each team member began working on one section, and updated the rest of the team with their progress. This way, we could all ensure we had something to work on, and that the workload was equally balanced. When one team member was finished with their section, they would notify the rest of the team, and then start working in another section where someone else was struggling.
